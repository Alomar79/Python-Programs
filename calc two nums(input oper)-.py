# Write a python program that asks the user to enter two 
# integers (a and b) and a character c. 
# The program performs an arithmetic operation and prints the result 
# depending on the value of c as follows:
#    + :    a + b
#    - :    a – b
#    * :    a * b
#    / :    a / b
#    % :    a % b
# 
# If the user enters a different character than the options in 
# the list above, the program should prints out
#  ”“Invalid operation. Please try again.
# Show in your sample output a run of all possible cases for 
# the following integers    a = 4    b = 6
